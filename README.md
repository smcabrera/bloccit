## Bloccit: a Reddit clone to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails 4

Made with my mentor [Matt
Tanguay-Carel](http://about.me/matthieu.tanguay.carel) at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

### Setup
password information stored in config/application.yml. See examples at config/application.example.yml for the names of these environment variables. If you'd like to clone this app and configure it for your own environment create your own config/application.yml file and set the environment variables accordingly.
